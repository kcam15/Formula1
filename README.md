The primary objective of this report is to analyze historical Formula One data and develop a predictive model to forecast the performance of drivers in upcoming races.

Background:
Formula One racing, characterized by its high-speed and technologically advanced cars, presents a dynamic and competitive environment where various factors influence driver performance. Analyzing historical data encompassing driver attributes, team dynamics, track characteristics, and race outcomes can unveil patterns and trends crucial for understanding and predicting future results

Data sources:
